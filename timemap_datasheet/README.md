Ansible Playbook for Timemap Deployment
</h1>

An Ansible playbook for remote deployment of an instance of Timemap in conjunction with a dedicated instance of datasheet-server. Multiple Timemap/Datasheet instances may be deployed to the same server, differentiated by the `application_name` set in `vault.yml` (see configuration steps below).

# Overview

The playbook's tasks are broken down into four subsets, which are stored in separate files:

* `prepare.yml` installs the relevant packages on the remote server.
* `datasheet.yml` configures and builds an instance Datasheet-Server on the remote server and launches it inside a docker container.
* `timemap.yml` configures and builds an instance of Timemap on the host machine and copies the static files to the remote server.
* `nginx.yml` configures the reverse proxy on the remote server

The subtasks are called in sequence from the `_master.yml` playbook file.

N.B. copies of the configuration files for both Timemap and Datasheet-Server in the `credentials` folder on the remote server.

# Configuration

First make sure [Ansible is installed](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) on the machine that will be running the playbooks. The remote server(s) that Ansible can connect to is specified in the local inventory, which is located here `./inventories/hosts`. See Ansible's [documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html) for more details on how to configure the inventory.

Copy `example.env` to a new `.env` file in the same folder and provide your own host group (a server specified in the inventory) and the location of the ssh key associated with this server.

Copy `example.vault.yml` to a new `vault.yml` in the same folder. The vault file contains all Timemap/Datasheet specific configuration. See the [Timemap](https://github.com/forensic-architecture/timemap) and [Datasheet-Server](https://github.com/forensic-architecture/datasheet-server) documentation for more infomation.

## Branch or Forked Git Repository

If you are working on a branch or forked repo you can override the Forensic Architecture defaults in `.env` as follows:

```
# override the defaults below with your own forked repository
# export DATASHEET_GIT_REPOSITORY='https://github.com/forensic-architecture/datasheet-server'
# export DATASHEET_GIT_BRANCH='develop'
# export TIMEMAP_GIT_REPOSITORY='https://github.com/forensic-architecture/timemap'
# export TIMEMAP_GIT_BRANCH='develop'
```

Note: the domain name can also be an IP address for example:

```
domain_name: '104.154.99.51'
````

# Running the Playbook

First run

```
source .env
```

in the folder where the `.env` file is located.

Then install the dependency Playbooks:

```
ansible-galaxy install angstwad.docker_ubuntu
```

The playbook can then be run via the command

```
ansible-playbook _master.yml

```
    # NOTE: no certbot automation, HTTPS still needs to be done manually as the
    # right options need to be selected. probably easy to fix.
    # - name: run certbot
    #   bash: sudo certbot --nginx -d {{ domain_name }}


## Time Map Google Cloud Platform Provisioning

If you don't have a server to run this on currently then you can set one up in the Cloud on a Google Cloud Platform Virtual Machine. For more info see [ReadMe](./timemap_datasheet/docs/GCP_README.md)
